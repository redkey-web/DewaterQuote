## Tips & Tricks

### Adding Product Images

**Best practices:**
- Use clear, well-lit photos
- White or plain backgrounds work best
- Show the product from the front
- Image should be at least 800x800 pixels

**Don't have good photos?**
- Ask your supplier for product images
- Take photos with your phone (make sure it's well-lit!)

### Pricing Tips

**Bulk Discounts are Automatic!**
The website automatically applies:
- 5% off for 2-4 items
- 10% off for 5-9 items
- 15% off for 10+ items

You don't need to calculate these - the system does it!

**POA (Price on Application)**
- Don't have a price? Leave it blank
- Website shows "POA" instead of a price
- Customer must request a quote

### Managing Product Variations

**Example: Pipe Coupling in different sizes**

Instead of creating 10 separate products:
1. Create ONE product: "Orbit Flex-Grip Coupling"
2. Check "Price Varies by Size"
3. Add each size as a variation:
   - 50mm - $45.50
   - 65mm - $52.00
   - 80mm - $58.50
   - etc.

**Why?** Easier to manage, looks better on the website!

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I change a price?**
A: Open the product → Edit the price → Save

**Q: Can I add multiple images to one product?**
A: Yes! Click "Upload Image" multiple times. The first image is the main one.

A: Don't worry! You can edit anything, anytime. Nothing is permanent.

**Q: How do I remove an image?**
