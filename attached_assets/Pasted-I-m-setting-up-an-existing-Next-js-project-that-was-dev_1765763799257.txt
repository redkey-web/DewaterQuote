I'm setting up an existing Next.js project that was developed locally. Please help me get it running on Replit.

### Project Overview

This is **DeWater Products** - an industrial pipe fittings e-commerce/quote system built with:
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Drizzle ORM + Neon PostgreSQL
- SendGrid for email
- NextAuth.js for admin authentication

### What's Already Configured

The project already has Replit configuration files:
- `.replit` - Run configuration (port 5000)
- `replit.nix` - Node.js 20 environment
- `next.config.js` - Platform detection for Replit vs Vercel
- `package.json` - Scripts configured for port 5000

### Environment Variables Needed

Please help me set up these secrets in Replit (Tools → Secrets):

```
DATABASE_URL=<Neon PostgreSQL connection string>
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<SendGrid API key>
FROM_EMAIL=<sender email address>
BUSINESS_EMAIL=<notification recipient email>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<random string for session encryption>
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://<replit-url>.replit.dev
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=<bcrypt hash of admin password>
```

### To Get Running

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Set up the environment variables in Secrets
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. The app should be available on port 5000 (mapped to external port 80)

### Important Notes

- **DO NOT** modify the `.replit`, `replit.nix`, or `next.config.js` files - they're already configured
- **DO NOT** reference the `_replit_backup/` folder - it contains legacy code from before the Next.js migration
- All routes are in `src/app/`
- All components are in `src/components/`
- Product data is in `src/data/catalog.ts`
- The project uses App Router, NOT Pages Router

### If You See Errors

1. **Module not found**: Run `npm install`
2. **Port in use**: Run `pkill -f next` then `npm run dev`
3. **Database errors**: Check that `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly in Secrets
4. **Build errors**: Run `npm run build` to see detailed TypeScript errors
