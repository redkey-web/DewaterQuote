Goals for the new site structure
Make browsing simple and logical — group products by type first (e.g., Couplings, Valves, Expansion Joints, Strainers), with brands shown as supporting options rather than mixed in.

Use consistent, easy-to-recognise names so customers can quickly identify the right product category — the same terminology should appear on the site and in Google search results.

Highlight the key product families prominently in the main menu, so customers can get to them in one click.

Streamline the quote process by introducing a clear “Add to Quote” feature and an easy path to access or request the price list.

Lay the groundwork for better search visibility (so Google can understand and display more relevant links like “Duckbill Check Valve” or “Pipe Couplings” directly in results).

Old links will still work and simply forward to the new ones.

Page types (so everything connects neatly)
Family hubs (e.g., Valves): short overview, typical applications, and links to subcategories.

Category pages (e.g., Duckbill Check Valves): when and why to use each type, datasheets, and an “Add to Quote” button.

Brand hubs: brief brand story, certifications, and links to their relevant products.

Industry pages: outline of typical needs by sector with recommended products.

Resources/Guides: articles like “What is a Y Strainer?” or “Duckbill vs Ball Check Valve,” each linking back to the right product category.

Quote and enquiry flow
RFQ (Request for Quote) cart: customers can add multiple products to a quote list and submit them all in one form.

Gated price list: short form that gives instant download access and sends the file by email.

Clear secondary contact option: “Talk to our experts.”

Why this helps
Makes it far easier for customers to find what they need without searching multiple times.

Creates a consistent and professional structure that’s easier to maintain and grow.

Builds stronger visibility on Google as products are grouped logically.

Reduces time spent fielding basic product-location or price-list enquiries.
